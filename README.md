# SmartParallel-328PB
Atmel ATMEGA328PB code for SmartParallel project.

This is a work in progress.

It requires a number of [my libraries](https://github.com/mspeculatrix/avr-lib), so you'll need to ensure you set these up appropriately. 
I created this code in Atmel Studio 7, which takes care of stuff like Make files, which is why you won't find one here. So you'll need to take care of that too.
